# Independent Study Objective

After this independent study I will:
* Have my part 107 licence
* Successfully have designed the launch system
* Have all the calculations documented for the launch system
* Work with the structures team on other ongoing projects for the UAS prototype
* Work on fabrication of the tail and wings of the prototype
* Flown and conducted performance tests for the first design 


# Independent Study Plan Narrative Description 

This semester my main goals are to get my part 107 licence, complete monokoting the wings, file down all the 3D printed parts for the tail and wings, build the tail and wings, and to get a launch system design ready and hopefully start building it. The part 107 licence testing shoud be done by spring break. 
After attaining that, I will start with the launch system design and make parts on SolidWorks for that. For fabrication of parts for the launch system I hope to get some help and learn more in the process as this would be the first time I work on something like this. 
I will also have to come up with some feasible methods to make different cradle designs for all of our future UAS prototypes.
The calculations that I do in order to make the launch system will be all documented at the end of the semester in an excel file. 
Lastly, I will also ensure I get some basic woodshop and Boyd lab training so I can start fabrication next semester and take up some of Jordan's responsibilties after he leaves.

# Risks and Mitigations

* **Risk**: Not having all the launch system parts integrate well with each other perfectly.
* **Mitigation**: To mitigate this risk, I will make sure I work well with other team members and get their opinions and advice on certain matters as I am not really good with fabrication yet. I am still learning!
